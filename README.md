# Covid-19 world statistics

## Introduction

### About the requirements

> This project is the third Microverse program capstone (react&redux). It about build a React and Redux SPA showing the world statistics of covid-19 pandemic. Check out [here](https://www.loom.com/share/7b30fae4f1a449559e8c887d525ed83b) the video presentation for more details.

I had to put together all the knowledge I gained from the React/Redux module at Microverse in order to build this project in 5 working days. The project had to be API-based and the requirements included: 



### About the project

All data in this App are comming from [The covid19 tracking API](`https://api.covid19tracking.narrativa.com/api/).
It's a single page app called **Covid-19 world statistics** which allows the user to see all stats about the covid19 in any country all over the world.

As a user:
- I can see on the home page the list of countries and their cases number.
- When I click a country card, I'm taken to a page with the country's contamination details.

### Objectives
As a good learner in React and Redux, I had to learn how to build a SPA with React and Redux by:

- Build the project as a single page application (SPA) built with React and Redux.
- Retrieve the data from an API should be stored in the Redux store.
- Use a Filter stateless component to filter the data retrieved from the API.
- Use React Router so that every page should be accessible from a unique route.
- Deploy the project to make it accessible online;
